		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js Project with TailwindCSS",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js and TailwindCSS setup into subtasks covering: 1) Initial project creation and dependency installation, 2) Page structure and routing setup, and 3) Layout component creation with responsive design implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard project initialization task with clear steps. While it involves multiple technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS), these are well-documented with established patterns. The task is straightforward but requires attention to detail in configuration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Map Integration with GeoJSON",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the map integration task into subtasks covering: 1) Map library installation and basic component setup, 2) GeoJSON data creation and integration, 3) Interactive features implementation (zone selection, popups), and 4) Responsive design and cross-device testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating specialized mapping libraries and implementing interactive geospatial features. Working with GeoJSON, handling map events, and ensuring proper rendering across devices adds moderate complexity. The task requires both technical implementation and visual design considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Homepage",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the homepage implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Hero section and CTA design/implementation, 2) Map component integration with interactive elements, and 3) Responsive design with animations and transitions.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines UI/UX design with technical implementation. It requires integrating the previously built map component and creating an engaging, responsive interface. The complexity comes from balancing aesthetics with functionality and ensuring good performance across devices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Explore Page with Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the explore page implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Table/card component creation, 2) Filter components and UI, 3) Filter logic and data service implementation, 4) Map integration for zone visualization, and 5) Responsive design with pagination.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex UI components, state management for filters, conditional rendering, and integration with the map component. The combination of tabular data display, multiple filter types, and responsive design considerations makes this more complex than standard page implementations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Product Page",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the product page implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Dynamic routing and data fetching setup, 2) Product information display components, 3) Map integration for area visualization, and 4) Conditional rendering for purchase/download options.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing dynamic routing, conditional rendering based on product state, and integrating multiple components. The complexity comes from handling various data types and ensuring the UI adapts to different product states and user permissions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system implementation into subtasks covering: 1) State management setup, 2) Registration and login forms with validation, 3) Password reset functionality, 4) Protected routes implementation, and 5) Session persistence and security considerations.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication is inherently complex due to security considerations, state management across the application, and multiple user flows (registration, login, password reset). This task requires careful implementation to avoid security vulnerabilities while ensuring a smooth user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Checkout Page with Stripe Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the checkout implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Shopping cart state management, 2) Checkout UI components, 3) Stripe integration for payment processing, 4) Success/failure handling with redirects, and 5) Cart persistence implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating payment processing adds significant complexity due to security requirements, third-party API integration, and handling various payment states. This task requires careful error handling, state management, and ensuring a secure, reliable checkout flow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Account Page",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the account page implementation into subtasks covering: 1) User profile display and settings forms, 2) Purchase history implementation with download functionality, and 3) Authentication protection and responsive design.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves displaying user data, purchase history, and implementing account management features. While it requires integration with authentication and download functionality, the overall structure is straightforward with moderate complexity in the conditional rendering and data management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Backend API and Database",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Framework setup and database connection, 2) User authentication endpoints, 3) Map/file data endpoints with geospatial queries, 4) Purchase/order endpoints, 5) Data validation implementation, and 6) Development environment with seed data.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a backend with geospatial capabilities is highly complex. This task involves database schema design, API endpoint implementation, geospatial queries, authentication, and ensuring proper data validation. The combination of these elements and the specialized nature of geospatial data processing results in high complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File Storage with AWS S3",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the file storage implementation into subtasks covering: 1) AWS S3 configuration and local development mock, 2) File upload and download functionality, 3) Metadata storage and database integration, and 4) Access control and security implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Cloud storage integration involves working with external APIs, handling file uploads/downloads, and implementing proper security measures. The complexity comes from managing different environments (production vs. development), ensuring secure access control, and handling various file types and metadata."
